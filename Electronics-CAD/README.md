Add the .lib files in this folder to Kicad
Poe_Elias.lib includes an Arduino Uno symbol from a different classmate
Raspberry_Pi_2_3.lib is from https://github.com/lukaneco/Raspberry-Pi-3-library-for-kicad but their part is not actually used.
There are other parts saved to that library folder such as Raspberry_Pi_3 that Case modified existing parts for.

Run The-Wanderer.sch in Kicad to edit the schematic.
