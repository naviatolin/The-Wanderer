## Hello Friend! 
I am the wanderer - Olin College's very own wandering robot. I walk through the Academic Center and interact with people I see to make their days better! I won't always see you, but when I do I say hello, let you pet me, and continue on with my day. If my battery is low, as I am a robot, I will definitely let you know so you can help me out!
