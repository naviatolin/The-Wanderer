## Goals

- Decide what we want for our team bonding
- Tonight: Have dinner, have fun

## What Did We Get Done

- Anna researched wheels
- Navi got first pages of github website showing
- We ran into an error where the raspberry pi crashed every time we tried to run the python code to detect people. We then tried to use Simple CV and other example people got working on their 1GB ram raspberry pis. The raspi continued to crash. :(

## Reflection (Where could we improve in the future?)
