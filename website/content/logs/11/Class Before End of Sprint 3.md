## Class Before End of Sprint 3

On the mechanical side, the robot was completely assembled by Anna and Michael on Sunday. Case  uploaded the Arduino code to the robot and modified to work for the new Servo motors. One leg was not working correctly, and from Case and Michael trouble shooting it became apparent that it was a mechanical issue.

## Goals

During today's class, we focused on fixing the mechanical issues with the legs. Anna and Michael worked on adding spacers and loosening joints for the legs so they would have less friction and be able to move. Navi and Case had finished their respective parts of the code, Raspi writing to digital pins when it sees a person or is talking, and the Arduino running the motors and deciding when to stop (based on Raspi) or turn. We had the goals to upload speaker sounds to robot and to look at requirements of the website.

## What Did We Get Done

We fixed the mechanical issues and then tested the Arduino movement code. We fixed up the movement so that it successfully moves forward and turns. We also found that we will be prepared to upload to the robot because we can convert Notion pages to markdown or html. Tomorrow we will upload speaker sounds to robot.
