## Goals

- Get started on the individual tasks that we have assigned.

## What Did We Get Done

- decided on walking mechanism - wheels for
- case: wheels running
- how the legs will incorporate
- chassis cad
- started on circuit schematic related things
- opencv testing

## Teaching team feedback

- Adding an axis of movement increases difficulty by a lot
- Having legs that move is much more difficult than wheels, so may have to go back to wheels
- Make sure the software can do what we want it to early, because if we run into issues with computer vision it will halt progress in our project
- Sensing is a difficult part, especially for connecting the sensing to the computer vision
