## Goals

- Mechanical: decide on a chassis design, get cadding
- chat with aaron about stability and weights
- finish figuring out raspi arduino stuff
- brainstorm and try different code

## What Did We Get Done

- Case&Navi: Looked at digital IO on Raspi, played with camera angles (45deg is best), block diagrams/state machine of robot behavior
- Anna & Michael: Sketched out chassis stuff, talked about motor power and structure stability, walks with weights
- Michael: Ordered perfboard for the circuit
- Order sheet: IR sensor, speaker, motor, battery
