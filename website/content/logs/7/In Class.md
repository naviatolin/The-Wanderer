## Goals

- Construct the prototype from lasercut pieces
- Start working on different skins

## What Did We Get Done

- We got the Raspberry pi and the arduino to communication using i2c. The arduino blinks based on information sent to it using the raspi.

- We got some skins for the robot using the children's clothing we thrifted earlier.
- Cadded spacers, made edits to the chassis
- Laser cutting out a box for the chassis as a skin
- next revision will be putting this power supply on a piece of metal
- need a thing that will shut off the robot if the power is overdrawn
- 2 amp 12 v to 5 v converter - the raspberry pi only taked 5v but the arduino can handle 12 but will step it down to 5 volts
