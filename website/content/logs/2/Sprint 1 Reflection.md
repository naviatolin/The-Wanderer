### Michael

### Anna

- good team dynamic
- productive meetings

- well scoped

## Deltas

### Case

- Did the assembly kinda last minute
- lasercutting was also a bit last minute, and if we had to make serious changes to the CAD the schedule would have gotten messed up (do earlier separate CAD? have a more set idea of things early? idk)
- not always sure what's happening with subtasks before i ask- clear progress checks about specific tasks is good moving forward into more complicated things
- uneven writing and tracking of tasks (team captain for a meeting)
- presentation was a little rocky, practice more

### Navi

- documentation and website/blog as this is our final deliverable
    - i could've done a better job as a pm
- need to set up clear tasks and objects every meeting - need to spend 10 minutes just doing stuff like this
- could've practiced presentation
- could've done another iteration as well?
- could've talked more about the personality as a group and had an ideation session
- next sprint should meet more outside of class

### Michael

- Improve aesthetics of robot for sprint 2
- Presentation practice
- Use github more
- Gimme more tasks!

### Anna

- not enough meetings
- Practice presentation/ evenly divide slides
- more involved schedule
- get my cad in github

## Next Sprint

Kaizen: More meetings and more documentation (be more thorough)
