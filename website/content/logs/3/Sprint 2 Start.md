## What Did We Get Done

- we got sprint 1 finished

## Reflection (Where could we improve in the future?)

We decided sprint priorities, scheduled our sprint tasks, and then focused on personality/aesthetic ideation

We want to track time we spend on tasks for sprints

We decided team bonding

we decided on immediate tasks

We were not able to start sprint tasks much

## Priorities for Sprint

- Good mobility → turning, walk forward
- Chassis fits all components, decide all components will be on all of it
- Figure out sensor requirements, what components we will have
    - We decided to do minimum sensors for now, and scale up if needed. This means the head will just have one servo
    - Two DC motors for legs, one IR sensor, Raspi camera, Raspi speaker, Arduino & motor shield, Raspi, servo for head tilt
- Raspi and Arduino communication, proof of concept that we can send commands to Arduino
- Personality/design goals → decide what inspiration we want for design and what thing we want to
